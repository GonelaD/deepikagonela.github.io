# Greetings!

I'm Deepika Gonela, a versatile professional with extensive experience in both Full Stack Development and Data Science. My journey in the tech world has been marked by a rich blend of hands-on expertise and an insatiable curiosity to explore the boundaries of these two fascinating fields.

Educationally, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science at Stony Brook University. My academic voyage began at the renowned Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IIT Hyd), where I earned my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science. 

I recently concluded my internship at **Amazon Web Services** as an **SWE (ML) Intern** where I got to dive into  ML systems and workflows, optimizing serverless model training for AWS's Recommender Systems and making deployments smoother! 

Previously, during my stint at **Publicis Sapient** as a **Senior Data Scientist**, I had the privilege of contributing significantly to KaaS, Publicis Sapient's NLP accelerator. We crafted some exciting NLP proofs of concept, ranging from Chatbots to Semantic Information services, and Perception Analysis Platforms. Outside work, I also explored the domain of **Product Management** (more details in [projects](projects.md#projects))! 

Beyond the tech world, I love memes, dogs, mountains, sunsets and contemplating life at ungodly hours. I like to think of myself as a blend of tech-savvy and a lover of life's little quirks. 

I'm **actively seeking Fall '23 / Winter '24 internships and/or full time roles starting April '24 as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Software Engineer, Applied Scientist, Product Analyst, Quantitative Analyst**.
