# Experience

## Adobe Systems - Cloud Technology 
**Member of Technical Staff 2 (Full Stack Developer)**  
*Aug 2020 - Aug 2022 | Bengaluru, India*
- *Technologies: ReactJS, Typescript, Java, Springboot, Python, Adobe IMS *

- **Frontend Development**:
- In the domain of frontend development, I undertook the task of architecting websites from the ground up, harnessing the capabilities of React and TypeScript. The primary objective was to deliver exceptional user experiences by creating highly responsive and visually appealing web interfaces. Ensuring optimal performance for a user base exceeding **50,000+** on a global scale was paramount. This was achieved through meticulous optimization efforts. Notably, code quality was significantly elevated, reaching an impressive **95% test coverage** with Jest development. This strategic approach not only fortified the software's reliability but also contributed to an impeccably seamless user interaction.

- **Backend Development**:
- In the backend sphere, my focus was on the creation of a robust infrastructure utilizing Java and Spring Boot. This backend architecture served as the foundation supporting the front end. Security was of paramount importance, and this was addressed through the implementation of [**Adobe IMS**](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/security/ims-config-and-admin-console.html?lang=en), playing a pivotal role in the management of access control, ensuring data protection, and reinforcing system integrity. The backend's resilience and security were thus meticulously fortified.

Trained T5 and DistilBERT models and experimented with merging with benchmark datasets achieving best f1-score of 0.80 & 0.73 for negative & positive sentiments respectively.
- **Conversational AI:** Built the cognitive intelligence chatbot platform using Elasticsearch, Rasa, and AWS to answer queries from user uploaded / client-specific knowledge base. Deployed to FastAPI endpoint for faster retrieval. The cognitive platform used for customer service resulted in **1.84x** more conversions. 
- **Database Management:** Encrypted passwords on MongoDB backend using salting mechanism to secure **thousands of user accounts** across two platforms. Implemented a robust authorization and authentication system using row-level locking.
