# Experience

## Adobe Systems - Cloud Technology 
**Member of Technical Staff 2 (Full Stack Developer)**  
*Aug 2020 - Aug 2022 | Bengaluru, India*
- *Technologies: ReactJS, Typescript, Java, Springboot, Python, Adobe IMS*

- As a Software Engineer, I had the opportunity to engineer websites from the ground up using **React and TypeScript** for the front end, complemented by **Java and Spring Boot** for the backend. One of my key achievements was developing an intuitive Admin UI for a notification system, where I prioritized streamlined project setup, robust security measures, and effective user management. This effort resulted in seamless user experiences and optimized website performance for a user base exceeding **50,000+ globally**. My commitment to code quality led to a **95% test coverage** through Jest development, ensuring the robust performance of our software. Additionally, I enhanced data security by implementing **Adobe IMS** with diverse access levels, safeguarding data and system integrity. Beyond web development, I orchestrated translation services for **Adobe Creative Cloud** across 18+ locales using Python scripts, improving accessibility for users worldwide. I also played a crucial role in maintaining high code quality through code reviews and QA testing. My passion for optimization led to developing an **Adobe Firefly app** and SDK, delivering a remarkable **52% performance boost** to translation processes.
