# Projects:


## ML / CV / NLP 

### Machine Learning Algorithms - 
Implemented K-means clustering on images, Principal Component Analysis for decorrelation,
Maximum Likelihood Estimates, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Sparse Auto Encoder from scratch (using only Numpy, Scipy)

### NLP Chatbot - 
This project involves building a chatbot using a Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model, trained on a dataset of movie dialogue lines. The chatbot can engage in text-based conversations by generating responses to user input. 

### Visual Question Answering - 
Integrated the VGG16 network for image understanding and an LSTM model for textual understanding on subset of VQA dataset to generate probability distribution of answers with a top-1 accuracy of 43%.

### Self-Supervised Learning on Visual Data - 
Developed a self supervised learning framework using SimCLR for object classification and detection using subsets of ImageNet dataset outperforming baseline supervised classification algorithm by 5%.

### Fine-Tuning Large Language Models - 
Fine-tuned a Dolly LLM on an FAQ dataset containing instruction and response fields using LoRA for efficient adaptation and evaluated the performance using metrics: cross entropy and perplexity. Analysed the LLM for bias and hallucination and deployed the fine-tuned model using Amazon Sagemaker.

### User Localization and Activity Recognition - 
Built a ML pipeline combining Random Forests and Neural Network architectures to predict a smartphone userâ€™s indoor location and activity performed based on WiFi Signal Strength and Sensor Data collected from Gyroscopes and Accelerometers with 90% and 96% accuracies respectively to identify anomalous activities.

### Fourier Features for Neural Networks - 
Implemented the paper "Fourier Features let Networks Learn High Frequency Functions in Low Dimensional Domain" on IIT Hyderabad campus images. The implementation demonstrates how to incorporate Fourier features into neural networks to enable them to learn high-frequency functions (images) efficiently in a low-dimensional domain.


## Data Science / Analytics

### Researching Recession Proof Retail Trades -
Conducted research on the impact of recessions on retail trades and analyzed sales trends during economic fluctuations. Applied statistical methods, such as Welch test, Linear Regression, and ANOVA to provide data-driven insights into the changes in retail trades during recessions

### Healthcare Visualization of Washington State - 
Designed and implemented a Tableau dashboard showing informational statistics about clinics, pharmacies, and hospitals in the Washington state filtered by city. Derived a ranking for the top ten hospitals and clinics, and analyzed relationships between hospital beds and population

### Credit Card Default Analysis - 
Performed Exploratory data analysis to understand impact of demographic factors on default rate.Performed Linear Regression and utilized recursive feature elimination to identify best set of features achieving a default prediction accuracy of 82%.

### Adobe Analytics Challenge - 
Uncovered data insights around the Nike customer journey and provide data-backed recommendations, with the aim of reimagining the customer experience online using Adobe Analytics.

## Product 

### Amazon Prime Video Case Study - 
Devised user personas, conducted interviews to validate assumptions and produced a customer journey map pinpointing key touchpoints and areas for improvement, contributing to an enhanced user experience for Amazon Prime Video.
